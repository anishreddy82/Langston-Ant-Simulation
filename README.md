# Langston-Ant-Simulation
This is a Langston Ant Simulation done in C++. In this simulation, the ant is a *, and the color of the spaces are either white = ' ' 
or black = '#'.
The ant moves and changes direction depending on the color of the position it is on. If the color is white, the ant turns right 90 degrees, 
changes the color of the square to '#' and then moves forward one square. If the color is black, the ant turns left 90 degrees, changes the
color of the square to ' ' and then moves forward one unit.
This is my implementation of Langston Ant, and I will be cleaning up the code over time.
